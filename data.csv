Locked up a former President/citizen WITHOUT a trial &amp; treating him like an international terrorist. We demand Pres @AAliZardari immediate release. Never absconded from court. Nothing to hide!! Imprisoned without a single charge proven. Beyond political victimisation. #Pakistan https://t.co/jCdoeHGiGF

Have seen my father @AAliZardari go through courts and jails for 30 years (even during his Presidency) but have never seen a former military dictator (nor his cabinet) in court. Wonder why we never get civilian supremacy #Pakistan
Despite being kept in NAB custody for 68 days &amp; over an entire year of investigation (the one that conveniently started days before Selection 2018). NAB &amp; all the puppets horsemen have as much evidence as PTI deliveries - Zero. Pres @AAliZardari being sent to adiala jail today ??

We kicked out a dictator why is Pakistan still living with his remains #AbolishNAB. Accountability is about fair trials not mockery of justice by a body that is never/has never been answerable.

Today in my aunt’s ABSENCE in court her NAB custody was transferred to Judicial remand. We knew this was coming. Now NAB want to drag her from hospital bed despite doctors refusal. Our trial has not even begun. NAB cannot wait 48 hours to take my aunt to jail? (On investigation)
From yesterday evening my aunt Faryal Talpur was unwell. At 2AM in the morning upon insistence of NAB doctors - she was shifted to hospital. She refused to use ambulance wanted all discretion. Once admitted at polyclinic doctors refused to discharge her.
